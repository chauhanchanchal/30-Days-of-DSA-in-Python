## Goal of Day 1
 # 📘 Day 01: C++ Basics

This day focuses on **basic C++ programming concepts** required to start Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

The goal is to understand syntax, input/output, and simple logic building.


## 🧪 Programs Implemented

| No. | Program Name | Description |
|----|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | `01_hello_world.cpp` | Print "Hello World" using C++ |
| 2 | `02_input_output.cpp` | Taking input and displaying output |
| 3 | `03_operators.cpp` | Demonstration of basic operators |
| 4 | `04_even_odd.cpp` | Check whether a number is even or odd |
| 5 | `05_fizz_buzz.cpp` | Classic FizzBuzz problem |

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
- Understand basic C++ syntax
- Use `cin` and `cout` confidently
- Apply conditional logic
- Write and run simple C++ programs

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Language: **C++**
